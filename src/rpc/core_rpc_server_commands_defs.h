///
/// - `service_node_pubkeys` -- Array of public keys of registered service nodes to request

/// - `active_only` -- If true then only return active service nodes.
///
/// - `limit` -- If specified and non-zero then only return a random selection of this number of
///   service nodes (in random order) from the result.  If negative then no limiting is performed
///   but the returned result is still shuffled.
///
/// - `poll_block_hash` -- If specified then only return results if the current top block hash is
///   different than the hash given here.  This is intended to allow quick polling of results
///   without needing to do anything if the block (and thus SN registrations) have not changed
///   since the last request.

///
/// - `height` -- the height of the current top block.  (Note that this is one less than the

/// - `target_height` -- the target height of the blockchain; will be greater than height+1 if this
///   node is still syncing the chain.
/// - `block_hash` -- the hash of the most recent block
/// - `hardfork` -- the current hardfork version of the daemon
/// - `snode_revision` -- the current snode revision for non-hardfork, but mandatory, service node
///   updates.
/// - `status` -- generic RPC error code; "OK" means the request was successful.
/// - `unchanged` -- when using poll_block_hash, this value is set to true and results are omitted

///   hash has changed this is set to false (and results included).  When not polling this value
///   is omitted entirely.
/// - `service_node_states` -- list of information about all known service nodes; each element is a
///   dict containing the following keys (which fields are included/omitted can be controlled via
///   the "fields" input parameter):
///   - `service_node_pubkey` -- The public key of the Service Node, in hex (json) or binary (bt).
///   - `registration_height` -- The height at which the registration for the Service Node arrived
///     on the blockchain.
///   - `registration_hf_version` -- The current hard fork at which the registration for the Service
///     Node arrived on the blockchain.
///   - `requested_unlock_height` -- If an unlock has been requested for this SN, this field
///     contains the height at which the Service Node registration expires and contributions will
///     be released.
///   - `last_reward_block_height` -- The height that determines when this service node will next
///     receive a reward.  This field is somewhat misnamed for historic reasons: it is updated
///     when receiving a reward, but is also updated when a SN is activated, recommissioned, or
///     has an IP change position reset, and so does not strictly indicate when a reward was
///     received.
///   - `last_reward_transaction_index` -- When multiple Service Nodes register (or become
///     active/reactivated) at the same height (i.e. have the same last_reward_block_height), this
///     field contains the activating transaction position in the block which is used to break
///     ties in determining which SN is next in the reward list.
///   - `active` -- True if fully funded and not currently decommissioned (and so `funded and not
///     active` implicitly defines decommissioned).
///   - `funded` -- True if the required stakes have been submitted to activate this Service Node.
///   - `state_height` -- Indicates the height at which the service node entered its current state:
///     - If `active` is true: this is the height at which the service node last became active
///       (i.e.  became fully staked, or was last recommissioned);
///     - If decommissioned (i.e. `funded and not active`): the decommissioning height;
///     - If awaiting contributions (i.e. `not funded`): the height at which the last contribution
///       (or registration) was processed.
///   - `decommission_count` -- The number of times the Service Node has been decommissioned since
///     registration
///   - `last_decommission_reason_consensus_all` -- The reason for the last decommission as voted by
///     the testing quorum SNs that decommissioned the node.  This is a numeric bitfield made up
///     of the sum of given reasons (multiple reasons may be given for a decommission).  Values
///     are included here if *all* quorum members agreed on the reasons:
///     - `0x01` - Missing uptime proofs
///     - `0x02` - Missed too many checkpoint votes
///     - `0x04` - Missed too many pulse blocks
///     - `0x08` - Storage server unreachable
///     - `0x10` - oxend quorumnet unreachable for timesync checks
///     - `0x20` - oxend system clock is too far off
///     - `0x40` - Lokinet unreachable
///     - other bit values are reserved for future use.
///   - `last_decommission_reason_consensus_any` -- The reason for the last decommission as voted
///     by *any* SNs.  Reasons are set here if *any* quorum member gave a reason, even if not all
///     quorum members agreed.  Bit values are the same as
///     `last_decommission_reason_consensus_all`.
///   - `decomm_reasons` -- a gentler version of the last_decommission_reason_consensus_all/_any
///     values: this is returned as a dict with two keys, `"all"` and `"some"`, containing a list
///     of short string identifiers of the reasons.  `"all"` contains reasons that are agreed upon
///     by all voting nodes; `"some"` contains reasons that were provided by some but not all
///     nodes (and is included only if there are at least one such value).  Note that,
///     unlike `last_decommission_reason_consensus_any`, the `"some"` field only includes reasons
///     that are *not* included in `"all"`.  Returned values in the lists are:
///     - `"uptime"`
///     - `"checkpoints"`
///     - `"pulse"`
///     - `"storage"`
///     - `"timecheck"`
///     - `"timesync"`
///     - `"lokinet"`
///     - other values are reserved for future use.
///   - `earned_downtime_blocks` -- The number of blocks earned towards decommissioning (if
///     currently active), or the number of blocks remaining until the service node is eligible
///     for deregistration (if currently decommissioned).
///   - `service_node_version` -- The three-element numeric version of the Service Node (as received
///     in the last uptime proof).  Omitted if we have never received a proof.
///   - `lokinet_version` -- The major, minor, patch version of the Service Node's lokinet router
///     (as received in the last uptime proof).  Omitted if we have never received a proof.
///   - `storage_server_version` -- The major, minor, patch version of the Service Node's storage
///     server (as received in the last uptime proof).  Omitted if we have never received a proof.
///   - `contributors` -- Array of contributors, contributing to this Service Node.  Each element is
///     a dict containing:
///     - `amount` -- The total amount of OXEN staked by this contributor into
///       this Service Node.
///     - `reserved` -- The amount of OXEN reserved by this contributor for this Service Node; this
///       field will be included only if the contributor has unfilled, reserved space in the
///       service node.
///     - `address` -- The wallet address of this contributor to which rewards are sent and from
///       which contributions were made.
///     - `locked_contributions` -- Array of contributions from this contributor; this field
///       (unlike the other fields inside `contributors`) is controlled by the `fields` input
///       parameter.  Each element contains:
///       - `key_image` -- The contribution's key image which is locked on the network.
///       - `key_image_pub_key` -- The contribution's key image, public key component.
///       - `amount` -- The amount of OXEN that is locked in this contribution.
///   - `total_contributed` -- The total amount of OXEN contributed to this Service Node.
///   - `total_reserved` -- The total amount of OXEN contributed or reserved for this Service Node.
///     Only included in the response if there are still unfilled reservations (i.e. if it is
///     greater than total_contributed).
///   - `staking_requirement` -- The total OXEN staking requirement in that is/was required to be
///     contributed for this Service Node.
///   - `portions_for_operator` -- The operator fee to take from the service node reward, as a
///     fraction of 18446744073709551612 (2^64 - 4) (that is, this number corresponds to 100%).
///     Note that some JSON parsers may silently change this value while parsing as typical values
///     do not fit into a double without loss of precision.
///   - `operator_fee` -- The operator fee expressed in millionths (and rounded to the nearest
///     integer value).  That is, 1000000 corresponds to a 100% fee, 34567 corresponds to a
///     3.4567% fee.  Note that this number is for human consumption; the actual value that
///     matters for the blockchain is the precise `portions_for_operator` value.
///   - `swarm_id` -- The numeric identifier of the Service Node's current swarm.  Note that
///     returned values can exceed the precision available in a double value, which can result in
///     (changed) incorrect values by some JSON parsers.  Consider using `swarm` instead if you
///     are not sure your JSON parser supports 64-bit values.
///   - `swarm` -- The swarm id, expressed in hexadecimal, such as `"f4ffffffffffffff"`.
///   - `operator_address` -- The wallet address of the Service Node operator.

///   - `pubkey_x25519` -- The service node's x25519 public key for auxiliary services (mainly
///     used for `quorumnet_port` and the `storage_lmq_port` OxenMQ encrypted connections).
///   - `last_uptime_proof` -- The last time we received an uptime proof for this service node from
///     the network, in unix epoch time.  0 if we have never received one.
///   - `storage_server_reachable` -- True if this storage server is currently passing tests for the
///     purposes of SN node testing: true if the last test passed, or if it has been unreachable
///     for less than an hour; false if it has been failing tests for more than an hour (and thus
///     is considered unreachable).  This field is omitted if the queried oxend is not a service
///     node.
///   - `storage_server_first_unreachable` -- If the last test we received was a failure, this field

///   - `storage_server_last_unreachable` -- The last time this service node's storage server failed

///     has never failed a test since startup.
///   - `storage_server_last_reachable` -- The last time we received a successful ping response for
///     this storage server (whether or not it is currently failing). Will be omitted if we have
///     never received a successful ping response since startup.
///   - `lokinet_reachable` -- Same as `storage_server_reachable`, but for lokinet router testing.

/// Performs a simple ONS lookup of a BLAKE2b-hashed name.  This RPC method is meant for simple,

///
/// Inputs:
///
/// - `type` -- The ONS type (mandatory); currently support values are: `0` for Session, `1` for
///   wallet, and `2` for Lokinet.
/// - `name_hash` -- The 32-byte BLAKE2b hash of the name to look up, encoded as 64 hex digits or
///   44/43 base64 characters (with/without padding).  For bt-encoded requests this can also be
///   the raw 32 bytes.
///
/// Outputs:
///
/// - `encrypted_value` -- The encrypted ONS value, in hex.  Will be omitted from the response if
///   the given name_hash is not registered.
/// - `nonce` -- The nonce value used for encryption, in hex.  Will be omitted if the given name is
///   not registered.
///
/// Technical details: the returned value is encrypted using the name itself so that neither this
/// oxend responding to the RPC request nor any other blockchain observers can (easily) obtain the
/// name of registered addresses or the registration details.  Thus, from a client's point of
/// view, resolving an ONS record involves:
///
/// 1. Lower-case the name.
/// 2. Calculate the name hash as a null-key, 32-byte BLAKE2b hash of the lower-case name.
/// 3. Obtain the encrypted value and the nonce from this RPC call (or ONS_NAMES_TO_OWNERS); when
///    using json encode the name hash using either hex or base64.
/// 4. Calculate the decryption key as a 32-byte BLAKE2b *keyed* hash of the name using the
///    (unkeyed) name hash calculated above (in step 2) as the hash key.
/// 5. Decrypt (and verify) using XChaCha20-Poly1305 (for example libsodium's
///    crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt) using the above decryption key and using the
///    first 24 bytes of the name hash as the public nonce.
///
/// Example input:
///
/// To look up the lokinet address for blocks.loki, we first need to get the name hash.  Using
/// Python, for example:
///
/// ```python
/// >>> import hashlib
/// >>> import base64
/// >>> name_hash = hashlib.blake2b(b'blocks.loki', digest_size=32).digest()
/// >>> base64.b64encode(name_hash)
/// b'IeynFEjyxigd0Lcmo5FWYaGp/uVXsa5grK8Jml0ai3o='
/// ```
///
/// Which then allows the RPC lookup:
///
/// ```json
/// { "type": 2, "name_hash": "IeynFEjyxigd0Lcmo5FWYaGp/uVXsa5grK8Jml0ai3o=" }
/// ```
///
